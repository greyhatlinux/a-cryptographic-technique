<h1>Ceaser Cipher</h1>
<h2>a cryptographic technique</h2>

<h4>A brief idea about ceaser cipher:</h4>
It is a mono-alphabetic cipher wherein each letter of the plaintext is substituted by another letter to form the ciphertext. It is a simplest form of substitution cipher scheme.  This cryptosystem is generally referred to as the Shift Cipher. The concept is to replace each alphabet by another alphabet which is ‘shifted’ by some fixed number between 0 and 25.
